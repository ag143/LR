Since some of the terms are given on LoadRunner official site, but I think those are not sufficient for a beginner. I have added some more terminologies which are commonly used in LoadRunner. These terms are:

<br>
<br>SLA: Service Level Agreement is a mutual agreement between the client and tester on Performance Metrics. This can also be termed as “Performance Requirement”.
<br>Example: The application X should handle 100 users load with 2 TPS for an hour.
<br>Performance Metrics: These are the units of measurement for client, server and network statistics.
<br>Example: Transaction per second, Response Time, Throughput, etc.
<br>Transaction: A transaction is a set of end-user actions that represent the real user activities on the application.
<br>Example: Log in, Click on Link, Click Submit button, Log out, etc.
<br>Business Process: A sequence of steps that represent a use case or a business function. It includes one or more transactions.
<br>Example: Order a product
<br>Scenario: It is a collection of business processes based on performance requirements. A scenario is a window where you can define no. of users, test duration, <br>Vuser running pattern, etc. along with business processes.
<br>Virtual Users or Vusers: Vusers emulate the real world users. No. of user (Vuser) count needs to be given in the scenario as per SLA.
<br>Protocol: The method of communication between a client and the server. The selection of protocol depends on the language/technology used for an application.
<br>Example: Web HTTP/HTML, Ajax TruClient, etc.
<br>Load Generator: These are the physical machines used to generate virtual users.
<br>Controller: It organizes, drives, manages, and monitors the performance test.
<br>Iteration: Repetition of transaction flow specified in the Vuser script.
<br>Pacing: Delay between two Iterations
<br>Think Time: Delay between two transactions
<br>Action(): The main piece of script which will be considered for performance test
<br>Analysis: This tool is used to conduct an analysis of the test result. Test report in different formats is generated through an analysis tool only.
<br>Correlation: This is a method to handle dynamic values, generated by the server during the test.
<br>Parameterization: It is used to pass different values into defined variables during the performance test.
<br>Example: A scenario has 5 users with UserID AA, BB, CC, DD and EE, so these values will be passed in variable _userID during the test.
<br>Rendezvous points: The point where Vusers wait for all other Vusers to arrive and then hit the next transaction simultaneously. It is used to generate full <br><br>traffic on any specific functionality.
